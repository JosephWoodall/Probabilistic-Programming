# Probabilistic-Programming

#### Deep learning works in situations where you have so much data that you can find the optimal choice very carefully by running computations over and over.

#### Probabilistic programming works in situations where you have a very small amount of data, but you still want to plausibly understand the search space that could reasonably define your function.

##### This allows us to confront new problems that we wont be able to solve with deep learning.
